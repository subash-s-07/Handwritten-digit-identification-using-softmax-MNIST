# MNIST Digit Recognition Web App

This web application, developed with Streamlit, allows real-time digit recognition using Softmax Regression. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, and neurons are added from different smaller models to achieve the best accuracy. The UI provides a clean and interactive experience.

## Features:

- **Real-Time Digit Recognition:** Upload or draw a digit to get instant predictions.
- **Softmax Regression:** Machine learning model for digit classification.
- **Neural Network Enhancement:** Improved accuracy through added neurons.

## Technologies Used:

- **Streamlit:** Fast and easy creation of web apps.
- **NumPy:** Numerical computing library for Python.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library for Softmax Regression.
- **MNIST Dataset:** Handwritten digit dataset for model training.
